Description
-----------
Management of party-related data, such as persons, organisations, names, addresses, etc. Based on the OASIS-Standard xPIL (Extensible Party Information Language).

Todo
----
Prio 1
* Image: Don't show reference to address when used in party and vice-versa
* Create patch for static_info_tables (div->selectItemsTCA)
* Create label_user_func for all tables which do not have a clear label field
* Show only the possible 'name types' according to the party type
* Events: Define in the type of the event whether it's a single point in time or a time range. Show only the possible fields
* ISO-Standard for West/East/North/South?

Prio 2
* Create new static extension for stock markets (done, proposed to Franz Holzinger for integration into static_info_tables)
* Update stock_markets to use hotlist once it's included in static_info_tables
* All date and date/time fields: Extend beyond UNIX time range (e.g. tx_party_persons: birth_date_time)
* 'Optimize' the use of the generated labels (e.g. define a label for "party" only once)
* General: Concept which allows it to either use an existing record or define a free text (e.g. issuingAuthority of an Account)
* Events: Extend type-definition (is is a single point in time or a time span?, is it allowed for persons and/or organisations?), perhaps as a general concept for types?
* Check all SQL definitions and remove unnecessary blob fields



Wishlist
--------
* Link to Google Maps for an address (either directly with lat/long or trying to resolve the address)
* "Normalize/verify" addresses using the Google API Geocoder (Feedback from Christoph Koehler)



To discuss
----------
* Where should the dependant records be stored? Same page, storage page, ...?
* Which tables shall be "manually sortable"?
* tx_party_contact_numbers: Should contact_hours be an RTE field?
* Should Eye Colour and Skin Colour also be select fields?

Suggestions for IRRE
* newRecordLinkAddTitle option: Optionally, this can be an LLL reference which will be used instead of the label of the table


Design decisions
----------------
* Inherited classes (e.g. person/organisation from party) are built as one database table, with the name of the base class.
** Advantages
*** Simple data access, no joins or views necessary
*** TYPO3 standard mechanisms (the "type-field") can be used to limit the available fields according to the inherited class
** Disadvantages
*** There are unused database fields in every record
*** No direct representation of the class model with the physical database model
